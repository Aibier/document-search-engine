## A search engine for company documentation

The company has many teams writing technical documentation on Google Docs for their products and processes.

But knowledge sharing across teams is hard because there is no good way to search the body of text on Google Docs.

In addition, employees find some documents especially useful and want to highlight them in search results.

We propose building a search engine for the companyâ€™s documentation that learns which documents are useful to employees and helps employees find them.
